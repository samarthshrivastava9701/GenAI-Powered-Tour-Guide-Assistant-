A Conversational AI Chatbot powered by LangChain, OpenAI GPT Models, and Streamlit Prompt engineering involves designing and constructing specific, structured prompts or instructions for language models to guide their outputs towards desired responses or tasks. It's a technique used to control or steer the behavior of large language models like GPT (Generative Preï¿½trained Transformer) models by providing them with input prompts that influence the generated text. Example of Prompt Engineering working model: Input: The below screenshot demonstrates the input portion where we have to upload the files and it will transform the data further to process it.
